This is a simple Python script to convert your Amazon Kindle highlights into raw text. I use it to clean up my highlights for Evernote.

Requirements:
1) Beautiful Soup
2) An HTML file containing your Kindle highlights. I've included a sample with some of my highlights so you can see what the process is like.

Free free to use this script for anything; it's in the public domain.
