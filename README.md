This is a simple Python script to convert your Amazon Kindle highlights into raw text. I use it to clean up my highlights for Evernote.

Your Kindle highlights are available at (kindle.amazon.com)[http://kindle.amazon.com] - not (kindle.com)[http://www.kindle.com].

Requirements:
1) Beautiful Soup
2) An HTML file containing your Kindle highlights. I've included a sample with some of my highlights so you can see what the process is like.
